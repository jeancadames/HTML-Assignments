    <p>
        This is one of my favorite movies from all the franchise, since for me it perfectly
        complements the entire development circle of the main character in the story, not 
        being Luke Skywalker for me, but his own father, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is one of my favorite movies since it gives the perfect closure for this character, 
        he manages to redeem himself for the love he always had but never recognized for his son, 
        and he manages to fulfill the prophecy he had, which was to bring balance to the force in 
        the galaxy
    </p>

    <p>
        For me it brought true balance since he lived half his life on the light side of the force, 
        he killed most if not all of the jedi, then he spent the other half of his life on the dark 
        side of the force, and He ended up killing the emperor who was the last Sith.
    </p>

    <p>
        To close, I consider the title of this film perfect, since Return of the Jedi does not refer 
        to Luke's return as a Jedi master, but to Anakin's return to the light side.
