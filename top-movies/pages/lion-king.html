    <p> From the saga of the lion king for me this is my favorite movie, I understand that
        what I like the most is nostalgia, but analyzing it critically, the animation for 
        the time seems very good to me, so good that to this day it still It continues well, 
        from its beginning to its end it has a soundtrack and a series of excellent music, 
        my favorite being the song that is used when they exile kovu from the pack, titled as 
        "Not One of Us".

        In the movie we can see how Simba becomes an exemplary king like his father, Mufasa, 
        and how he, despite how wise he already is, still learns new things, like the main 
        lesson of the movie, which for me is not judge anyone for the past or crime that a 
        family member committed, since Kovu's character was persecuted for a crime or sin 
        that he never committed, and was judged for the actions that Scar committed in the 
        first movie.
