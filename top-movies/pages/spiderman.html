        This is my favorite movie, not only of the spiderman character, but of the entire 
        superhero genre. I like the designs of the characters, from the spiderman suit, 
        its origin, and even the green goblin suit, despite the fact that most did not like 
        it.

        I emphasize that thanks to this film is that the genre of superheroes, a genre quite 
        exploited lately, has the great popularity of today. This movie leaves teachings, mainly 
        "A great power comes with a great personality", which we can see throughout the movie, 
        from the death of Uncle Ben through Peter's indirect fault, until the end of it, when 
        Peter rejects the love of his life, Mary Jane, due to the power he has, to protect the city, 
        and to protect those he loves, there are things that he cannot allow.
