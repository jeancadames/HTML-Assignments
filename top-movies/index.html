        Hello! My name is Jean Adames and you're probably wondering what is this website, 
        so let me explain you. This is a website for present my top 3 movies of all time,
        just to be clear, this is my personal opinion and I'm not any professional critic
        of this area, these are just my personal favorites movies, so I hope you can 
        understand my opinion and maybe even we can share it.
    </p>

        As an introduction, I really like action movies, but this top won't be just about this
        genre, I'll try to have the most genre movies, such as action movies, sci-fi and animated
        movies. Hope you enjoy it. You can see my top on the
        following link:
